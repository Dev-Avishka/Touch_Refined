# Touch Refined

## Description
Touch is a command that was never available for windows and was never implemented in the windows command prompt. This is a simple implementation of the touch command for windows. This command creates a new file if the file does not exist or updates the timestamp of the file if it does exist. 

This command also adds new features such as adding starter code to specific file types.

The file types that are supported are:
```bash
.py
.c
.js
.html
```

##how to build 
```bash
build.bat
```
then the new file will be created in the touch folder in the project
relocate that to C:\ or any other directory and then add it to path
